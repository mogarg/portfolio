      <description>Addressed pretty significant page load performance issue founde in larger deployments. Eliminates uses of intensive backend query, replacing it with an asynchronous API call against a lucene index. This change reduces page load from from 2+ minutes to nearly instant, with an incredibly responsive UI.</description>

      <description>This talk looked at Liberty Mutual’s transformation to Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and DevOps. For a large, heavily regulated industry, this task can not only be daunting, but viewed by many as impossible. Often, organizations try to reduce the friction through micro-fixes, but Eddie’s team asked how to change the culture to reduce the friction and concluded with the following final points:
 Don’t mandate DevOps. Give employees the chance to master their discipline with examples to set and follow.</description>

      <title>Added Docker Build Status Badge to shields.io</title>
      <link>https://mogarg.github.io/projects/contributions/shields-docker/</link>

      <description>Shields.io is a massive library of badges that can be inserted into project README&amp;rsquo;s or websites displaying various statuses (code coverage, health, version, etc). Support for docker was missing the current build health, and was a pretty trivial addition.</description>

      <description>Motivation While internet services are designed and deployed with an assumption of perimeter less security at the application layer, most production distributed systems today are designed assuming a classical Crash Fault Tolerant (CFT) model. In realistic deployment scenarios, keeping track of all bridged networks such as smartphones, network printers, etc. is almost impossible. Hence, designing distributed systems without considering the possibility of an active adversary makes the system vulnerable from its core.</description>
