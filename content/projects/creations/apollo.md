Apollo is a ticketing management system prototype. Musical events have several stakeholders like the music label,
the venue management and the artist themself. This smart-contract adds transparency to the process. Major features
include:

1. Buying tickets for a show, requiring the correct amount tickets cost
2. Transferring tickets to other wallets
3. Verifying ownership of tickets through contract methods.
