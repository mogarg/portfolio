**Hi, I'm Mohit, a Masterâ€™s Software Engineer with three years of Industry Experience. I have worked on improving Distributed Systems, led Mobile Development, and I have a strong interest in building scalable solutions to solve complex problems. I continue to be passionate about building core Distributed Systems like Cloud and Blockchains.**

As a Masters in Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech, I worked on a thesis on researching protocols that power Distributed Systems like Cloud and Blockchains for high throughput, global scalability, five 9's of availability in the presence of crashes and malicious behavior. I came up with a new Byzantine Fault-Tolerant protocol with numbers that achieve 3.5x over industry standards.

Before joining Virginia Tech, I worked for three years at Indus Valley Partners which provides award-winning software solutions for the Hedge Fund Industry. My love for Mobile First motivated me to help set up an iOS development team. We created Nebula a secure, highly customisable iPad application which enables Hedge Fund managers to study their analytics on the move. Working on this platform made for a rich understanding of framework conventions, best practices, memory management, and development tools. I also learned a lot about Finance and fell in love with Cryptography as a means to secure highly sensitive data.

I have since found passion and has worked on distributed data processing and search technologies such as Kafka, Hadoop, Elasticsearch and Blockchain technologies such as Smart Contracts for Ethereum and Hyperledger.

Beautiful code is of high priority for me; I love developing solutions which a developer can extend with a few keystrokes. I believe a Software Engineer has to evolve quickly as his technology. Consequently, I keep myself updated with the latest algorithms and programming principles. I also take MOOCs regularly, and I am currently enjoying going through one on Game Theory. I am equally keen on studying user behaviors and imbibe the best design practices in my applications for providing the best experience.
